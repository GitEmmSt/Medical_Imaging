By measuring projections along different angles, a sinogram is obtained that can be reconstructed to a 3D image (also see the previous practicum). Since the labeled pharmacon is subject to a certain metabolism in the patient, a 3D image of the physiology can be obtained with a SPECT camera. The technique is thus complementary to a CT scan, which images only anatomy.\n",

In order to obtain a measurement, we first need a **source** of photons, usually a patient injected with a radiotracer. Next we need a photon **detector** to measure the photons that leave the patient’s body. A third essential component of the gamma camera is the **collimator**. This is needed to sort out the desired direction. Many types of collimators exist, such as the parallel-hole collimator, the pinhole collimator, fan-beam collimators, etc, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In the case of a parallel hole collimator, we sort out the direction perpendicular to the detector surface.\n",
